two very different representations but control very similar perceptual properties 

contrast = structure
coherence = motion

- show the specific tuning for contrast
- specific model from the rees / simoncelli heeger model

naka-rushton vs. linear
both monotonic increases (neural basis)

contrast was one of the first variables seen-- motion coherence was sort of seen early on (linea rrelationship)

how do you link these models? boynton proposed it (for contrast) not for both variables at oncew

being more systematic + relationship between contrast adn motion (interactions?)

pose the main goals (encode and behavior as questions): how are these encoded, what's the rgiht linking model

fMRIL this is what we expect for contrast (responses in V1, all areas: early representation that 
For motion coherence it's less well studied but we can look at this across areas

What parameters exactly are we fitting

Add interaction parameter to model!
Estimate size of behavioral interaction from model interaction??????
slope of (% signal / % contrast)

take out shape/noise from first example
perception linked to populations (monkey single neurons)
ROIs = regions of interest slide 43
add timeseries adding up (fmri model)
sensitvity: color code contrast / motion coherence
difference in AIC is a binary outcome
get rid of length-weighted
x-axis labels!

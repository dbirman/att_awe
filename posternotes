notes:

remove top point for contrast curve

look up papers that motion coherence discrimination, what's the expectation

we can make coherence/contrast discrimination in the same way, the magnitude is different, --- one model fits to both, both curves need to saturate because non-linear behavioral responses 

cortical responses, not neural measures

drop the duration data to make the contrast/coherence data look good

or find example subjects who look good

fit 2-gamma functions to con-coh, then plot the magnitude estimates and fit the full model through those points (abstraction)

Framing: we're using contrast (it works! we know), we're questioning about coherence?

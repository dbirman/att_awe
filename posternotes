notes:

look up papers that motion coherence discrimination, what's the expectation

we can make coherence/contrast discrimination in the same way, the magnitude is different, --- one model fits to both, both curves need to saturate because non-linear behavioral responses 

Framing: we're using contrast (it works! we know), we're questioning about coherence?

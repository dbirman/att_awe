***CORTICAL***
Okay, so now we're going to get measurements related to this: passifve fixation and data from the actual task. We did all these together because we wanted to test the full range of stimulus parameters.

***LINKING MODEL***
Building on previous studies that have linked contrast discrimination to early visual cortex we'll fit a neural noise parameter to scale the behavior fits to the neural fits. This hasn't been applied to motion coherence so we're going to apply these models. 
Don't say ground truth.

Need a complete model, two parallel streams that lead to the sigma parameter, fit that parameter to scale between the two. 

You need two numbers at the end: 



HOLY SHIT:

This is the model fitting code, figure generating code, etc, from the paper:
Birman, D., & Gardner, J. L. (2018). A quantitative framework for motion visibility in human cortex. Journal of neurophysiology.

The second paper (linking physiology + perception) is in preparation.

To reproduce the results you will need to get access to the Box folder where the data is stored (email dbirman@stanford.edu). Once you have that folder copied locally you can modify the function `datafolder` to point to it.

Then you'll need to go through the function `run_alln` which steps through the model fitting and plotting for both papers.

Please email me with questions!

This is the model fitting code, figure generating code, etc, from the paper:
Birman, D., & Gardner, J. L. (2018). A quantitative framework for motion visibility in human cortex. Journal of neurophysiology. 
DOI: https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00433.2018
Preprint: https://doi.org/10.1101/359562
Data: https://osf.io/s7j9p/

The second paper (linking physiology and behavior): Flexible readout of stable cortical representations support motion visibility perception, is in preparation.

To reproduce the results you will need to get access to the Box folder where the data is stored (email dbirman@stanford.edu). Once you have that folder copied locally you can modify the function `datafolder` to point to it.

Then you'll need to go through the function `run_alln` which steps through the model fitting and plotting for both papers.

Please email me with questions!
